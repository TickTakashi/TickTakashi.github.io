Hi, Iâ€™m Charles.

I'm a Researcher in the Game AI Group at Queen Mary University of London, but I used to be a professional game designer for PC, mobile, and console.

I use this blog to provide the odd tutorial, share research and make comments on tech trends. Providing insights through the refined lenses of not really knowing anything.

TickTakashi is my little corner of the internet and, in case you're wondering, it was a nickname.
